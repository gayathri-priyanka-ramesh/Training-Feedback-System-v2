# Training-Feedback-System

## Taking on the Challenge
The "Training Feedback System" is intended to address the following challenges:
•	The need to collect and analyze feedback from participants who attend training sessions or workshops to evaluate training program effectiveness.
•	Inefficient manual feedback collection methods, which often result in incomplete or delayed feedback.
•	The absence of a comprehensive and centralized system for tracking training history, evaluating instructors, and identifying areas for improvement.
•	Data privacy concerns and the need to comply with data protection regulations in handling participant information and feedback data.

## User Modules
### 1. Participant Module
Participants can register for training sessions, submit feedback, access feedback history and reports, and optionally provide anonymous feedback.
### 2. Instructor Module
Instructors can view information about their training sessions, access participant feedback, review comments and ratings, respond to feedback, and use insights to improve their training techniques.
### 3. Administrator Module
Administrators can create and customize feedback surveys, manage participant data, monitor attendance and feedback submission, analyze feedback data, track instructor evaluations, and identify feedback trends and insights for program improvement.
